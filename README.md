Probo
===========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ProboCI/probo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ProboCI/probo)

Probo is an open source continuous integration and quality assurance tool
that lets you build branches and pull requests inside docker containers,
reports back on the progress of each step, and then *keeps the environment
around* and gives you a link so that you can go and preview the work in a
shared space.

## Quickstart

See the [Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) guide for how to get up and running with your own instance of Probo

## Compatibility
The code uses generators and requires node `io.js` or `node` 4.x+.
